To exploit code that someone else has written, one must obviously know how to code. You need not be an advanced programmer, but you must be strong in your fundamentals and computational thinking. Python is the standard for most CTF tasks - there are several essential libraries like pwntools and Z3Py, and it lets you get things done in a quick and dirty manner that's perfect for a time-constrained scenario like a CTF.

**Task:** Learn the basics of Python and become accustomed to thinking in code.
