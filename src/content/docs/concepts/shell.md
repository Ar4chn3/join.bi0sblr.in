As a hacker, programmer, or other advanced computer user, the terminal is your second home. You should be completely at ease using the shell and command-line programs, and do some light scripting when necessary.

[Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) is a great way to get started if you have no experience. It consists of a set of challenges, each of which contains the password to unlock the next one. This will help you learn a range of concepts and their practical application.

:::note[Task]
 Complete Bandit. This shouldn't take too long and you will likely learn a lot in the process.
