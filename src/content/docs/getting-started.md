This Recruitment drive is only for upcoming freshers and
        sophomores (Sem 3) in the Bengaluru campus ('24-'28 batch). We are not
        recruiting Third Years (Sem 5) students but you can still play the CTF
        tho.

Welcome, hacker! At bi0sblr, we're assembling a dedicated team of 1337 hax0rs to tackle today's CTF challenges and defend tomorrow's cyberspace. If you're on this page, it's probably because you're interested in being a part of this. Hacking is an advanced job - it needs a deep knowledge of the ins and outs of computer systems. This website is a place for you to learn the foundational skills that you will need to have a good grasp on to succeed. GLHF!

Remember, the primary goal of this is *learning* - being able to see the world of computing from a perspective you never had. There's an infinite number of ways to circumvent the tasks given, but you would just be cheating yourself. This isn't an exam!
