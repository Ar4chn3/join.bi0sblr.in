description: Understanding the stack and how buffer overflows work

### The Stack

The stack is a region of memory used for storing local variables, function parameters, and return addresses.

### Local Variables and Buffers

Local variables and buffers are often stored on the stack. When a buffer overflow occurs, it can overwrite adjacent memory, including other local variables and the return address.

#### Practice

<details>
<summary>Hands-On Exercise</summary>

> > **Visualize the stack:** Use GDB to examine the stack and observe how local variables are stored.
> > **Experiment with buffer overflows:** Write a C program with a vulnerable buffer and try to overflow it to change the value of another local variable.
