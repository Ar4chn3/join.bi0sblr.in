### 🕵️‍♂️ What is Network Forensics?

**Network Forensics** is the art of digging through digital footprints on the network, tracking down security incidents, and piecing together what went down. It’s like CSI, but for data packets.

* **Network forensics** involves the monitoring and analysis of network traffic to gather evidence and investigate security incidents.
* Tools like **Wireshark** are the go-to for packet capture and analysis in network forensics.
* **Anomalies** in network traffic can tip you off to potential security breaches.
* **Timestamps and logs** are your bread and butter for reconstructing events during an investigation.
* A deep understanding of network protocols, especially **TCP/IP**, is key to effective analysis.

### 🗂️ PCAP Files

**PCAP (Packet Capture)** files are your treasure maps—they store the network traffic captured during monitoring, ready for you to crack them open and find the buried loot.

* **PCAP files** can be analyzed using tools like Wireshark to identify patterns and potential security issues.
* Capturing packets in real-time with tools like **tcpdump** creates these files for analysis.
* These files are a goldmine for troubleshooting network issues with detailed packet-level info.
* You can **filter, search, and extract** specific data from PCAP files to dig into network activity.
