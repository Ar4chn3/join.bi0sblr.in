description: Basics on how websites and webpages work

### The same URL, same data sent, but different content?
You can use different HTTP request methods to get different webpages from the same URL! You can either GET the webpage from the web-server or you can POST data to the web server and it will return you a webpage or just some other data. If the developer of the website was a bit too fancy, they might have also made up their own reuqest methods for their servers.
