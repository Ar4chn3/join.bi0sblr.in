### What is Binary Exploitation?

Binary exploitation is the art of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in software at the machine code level. This can allow attackers to gain control of a system or access sensitive data.

### C Basics

Understanding the C programming language is essential for binary exploitation, as many programs are written in C. Key concepts include:

* **Data Types:** Integers, characters, arrays, pointers, etc.
* **Memory Management:** How memory is allocated and deallocated.
* **Functions:** How functions are defined and called.
* **Control Flow:** Using `if`, `else`, `for`, and `while` statements.
