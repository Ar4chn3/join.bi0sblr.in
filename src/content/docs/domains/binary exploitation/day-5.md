### Overwriting the Return Address

By overflowing a buffer, it's possible to overwrite the return address on the stack. This allows an attacker to redirect program execution to a different location, such as malicious code.

#### Practice

<details>
<summary>Hands-On Exercise</summary>

> > **Practice on a vulnerable program:** Use a vulnerable program (like a simple buffer overflow example) and GDB to practice overflowing the buffer and overwriting the return address.
> > **Write a simple exploit:** Create a Python script to generate the payload that overwrites the return address with a specific value.
