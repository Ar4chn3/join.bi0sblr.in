### GDB: The GNU Debugger

GDB is a powerful tool for debugging and analyzing programs. It allows you to step through code, examine memory, and inspect registers.

### Assembly Language

Assembly language is a low-level programming language that directly corresponds to machine code. Understanding assembly is crucial for binary exploitation.

### pwndbg: A GDB Enhancement

pwndbg is a plugin for GDB that makes it easier to work with exploit development tasks. [Install Here](https://samiux.github.io/pwn_ubuntu.html)
