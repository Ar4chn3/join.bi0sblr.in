### Data Types in Detail

Each data type has a specific size and range of values it can represent. Understanding these limitations is crucial for finding vulnerabilities.

### Integer Overflows

An integer overflow occurs when a program tries to store a value that is too large for the data type. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially be exploited.
