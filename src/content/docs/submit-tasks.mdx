### How to submit tasks
Format your `tasks` directory as shown below. Add a screenshot of the output of the `tree` command as well as a README.md in your directory along with Tasks
The README.md file should contain:

- Your name
- Your college email 
- Your Discord username

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<FileTree>
- tasks/
  - shell/
    - bandit_writeup.md
  - programming/
    - C/
      - chal-1.c
      - chal-2.c
      - chal-3.c
      - chal-4.c
    - Python/
      - chal-1.py
      - chal-2.py
      - chal-3.py
      - chal-4.py
</FileTree>

Put this in a public [GitHub repo](https://repo.new) and send the link to an admin on Discord or WhatsApp.

:::note[Remember]
The primary goal of this is *learning* - being able to see the world of computing from a perspective you never had. There's an infinite number of ways to circumvent the tasks given, but you would just be cheating yourself. This isn't an exam!
